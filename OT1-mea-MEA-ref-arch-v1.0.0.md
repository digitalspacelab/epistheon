## Purpose

The Minimal Epistemic Architecture (MEA) defines the smallest complete structural set required for epistemic operation within the Epistheon system.

It specifies the irreducible components necessary to initiate, conduct, and terminate epistemic processes.

---

## Core Principle

Minimality precedes elaboration.

No epistemic component is permitted unless it is structurally necessary.

---

## Minimal Component Set

The minimal epistemic architecture consists of:

1. Entry condition
2. Orientation phase
3. Boundary definition
4. Epistemic operation
5. Explicit termination

All components are mandatory.

---

## Structural Constraints

- Components are sequential.
- Components may not be merged.
- Components may not be omitted.

Violation of any constraint invalidates epistemic legitimacy.

---

## Relation to Other Architectures

MEA provides a minimal baseline.

More elaborate architectures may extend MEA but may not contradict or bypass its constraints.

---

## Canonical Statement

The Minimal Epistemic Architecture defines the irreducible structural requirements for epistemic operation.

It is complete, authoritative, and closed.

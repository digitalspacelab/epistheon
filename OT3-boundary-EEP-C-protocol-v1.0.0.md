## Purpose

Epistemic Execution Protocol C (EEP-C) defines mandatory termination, closure, and post-execution integrity conditions for all epistemic operations conducted under Epistheon.

It ensures explicit closure, prevents scope carryover, and preserves responsibility clarity after execution.

---

## Protocol Scope

This protocol applies at the end of every epistemic execution governed by EEP-B.

Termination under EEP-C is mandatory and non-optional.

---

## Termination Conditions

Termination must occur when any of the following conditions are met:

- epistemic objective is satisfied
- declared scope is exhausted
- boundary violation occurs
- execution is explicitly aborted

Termination may not be deferred.

---

## Closure Requirements

Upon termination:

1. Execution context is closed.
2. Boundaries are released.
3. Responsibility attribution is finalized.
4. No implicit continuation is permitted.

Closure must be explicit.

---

## Post-Execution Integrity

After termination:
- no further epistemic claims may be derived from the closed context
- no authority persists beyond closure
- results remain context-bound

Reopening requires a new Entry sequence.

---

## Failure Handling

Failure to terminate explicitly invalidates epistemic integrity.

Such failure requires immediate corrective termination.

---

## Canonical Statement

Epistemic Execution Protocol C establishes mandatory termination, closure, and post-execution integrity conditions.

It is complete, enforceable, and closed.

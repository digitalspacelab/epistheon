## Illustration Purpose

This executable illustration demonstrates a **minimal, compliant Epistheon flow**.

It is non-authoritative and exists solely to illustrate correct sequencing and boundary discipline.

---

## Executable Flow

### Step 1 — Entry

- Intent is explicitly declared.
- Epistemic scope is stated.
- Responsibility is acknowledged.

---

### Step 2 — Boundary Declaration

- Scope limits are fixed.
- Expansion is prohibited.
- Termination condition is named.

---

### Step 3 — Validation (EEP-A)

- Entry conditions are verified.
- Boundary validity is confirmed.
- Execution permission is granted.

---

### Step 4 — Epistemic Execution (EEP-B)

- Analysis or elaboration occurs.
- Scope remains fixed.
- Boundary awareness is continuous.

---

### Step 5 — Termination & Closure (EEP-C)

- Execution is explicitly terminated.
- Context is closed.
- No continuation is implied.

---

## Illustration Constraint

This illustration:
- defines no rules
- modifies no architecture
- introduces no authority

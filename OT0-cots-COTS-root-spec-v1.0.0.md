## Purpose

The Canonical Output Type System (COTS) defines the exclusive and binding classification of epistemic artifacts within the Epistheon system.

It establishes formal distinctions of authority, scope, and function across all system outputs.

---

## Core Principle

Every artifact belongs to exactly one output type.

Output type determines epistemic authority.

---

## Output Type Set

The output type set is finite and closed.

| Code | Output Type |
|------|-------------|
| OT0 | Foundational Specification |
| OT1 | Reference Architecture |
| OT2 | Layer / Model Specification |
| OT3 | Protocol Specification |
| OT4 | Executable Illustration |
| OT5 | Exploratory / Derivative Text |

No additional output types are permitted.

---

## Authority Rules

1. Higher output types override lower output types.
2. Lower output types may reference higher ones, never the reverse.
3. Output types may not be merged or combined.
4. Output type assignment is invariant per artifact.

---

## Scope Rules

- OT0 defines system-wide invariants.
- OT1 defines derived structural architectures.
- OT2 defines scoped layers or models.
- OT3 defines execution discipline.
- OT4 demonstrates compliant behavior.
- OT5 enables free exploration.

---

## Termination Rule

COTS defines classification only.

It does not authorize execution, interpretation, or application.

---

## Canonical Statement

The Canonical Output Type System establishes a closed, binding classification of epistemic artifacts.

It is complete, authoritative, and closed.

## Purpose

Epistemic Execution Protocol A (EEP-A) defines the mandatory validation sequence for boundary declaration and entry enforcement prior to epistemic operation.

It ensures that no execution proceeds without valid entry conditions and explicit boundary alignment.

---

## Protocol Scope

This protocol applies at the transition between the Entry Layer and any subsequent epistemic operation.

It is mandatory whenever epistemic execution is attempted.

---

## Execution Sequence

1. Verify explicit intent declaration.
2. Verify boundary definition.
3. Verify responsibility acceptance.
4. Confirm Entry Layer completion.

All steps must succeed.

---

## Failure Handling

If any verification step fails:
- execution is prohibited
- operation is terminated
- failure is explicit

No recovery within the same execution context is permitted.

---

## Authority Constraint

EEP-A enforces validation only.

It does not perform analysis, elaboration, or interpretation.

---

## Termination Rule

Failure at any stage triggers immediate termination.

Termination under EEP-A is final for the current context.

---

## Canonical Statement

Epistemic Execution Protocol A establishes mandatory boundary and entry validation prior to epistemic execution.

It is complete, enforceable, and closed.

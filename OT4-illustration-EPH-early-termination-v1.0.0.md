## Illustration Purpose

This executable illustration demonstrates **explicit early termination** when the declared epistemic objective is fulfilled before scope exhaustion.

It is non-authoritative and exists solely to illustrate compliant termination behavior.

---

## Executable Flow

### Step 1 — Entry

- Intent is explicitly declared.
- A narrow, verifiable epistemic objective is stated.
- Responsibility is acknowledged.

---

### Step 2 — Boundary Declaration

- Scope limits are fixed and minimal.
- The objective completion condition is named as a termination trigger.

---

### Step 3 — Validation (EEP-A)

- Entry conditions are verified.
- Boundary validity is confirmed.
- Execution permission is granted.

---

### Step 4 — Epistemic Execution (EEP-B)

- Analysis proceeds strictly within scope.
- The stated objective is achieved earlier than anticipated.

---

### Step 5 — Early Termination Decision

- Objective fulfillment is explicitly recognized.
- Further execution is deemed unnecessary.

---

### Step 6 — Termination & Closure (EEP-C)

- Execution is explicitly terminated.
- Context is closed without scope expansion.
- No continuation is implied.

---

## Illustration Constraint

This illustration:
- defines no rules
- modifies no architecture
- introduces no authority

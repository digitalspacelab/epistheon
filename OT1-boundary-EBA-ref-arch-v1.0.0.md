## Purpose

The Epistemic Boundary Architecture defines a formal reference architecture for identifying, enforcing, and terminating epistemic scope within Epistheon-based systems.

It operationalizes non-delegable responsibility, scope limitation, and termination conditions derived from the Epistheon root specification.

---

## Core Principle

Every epistemic operation requires an explicit boundary.

No interpretation, analysis, or execution is legitimate beyond a declared epistemic boundary.

---

## Boundary Definition

An epistemic boundary defines:
- scope of inquiry
- authority limits
- responsibility attribution
- termination conditions

Boundaries are declared prior to execution and may not be retroactively expanded.

---

## Responsibility Constraint

Responsibility remains non-delegable across all boundary-defined operations.

No boundary may transfer or obscure responsibility attribution.

---

## Boundary Enforcement

Boundary enforcement is mandatory.

Violations invalidate epistemic legitimacy and require immediate termination.

---

## Termination Conditions

Termination occurs when:
- boundary conditions are met
- boundary violations occur
- epistemic scope is exhausted

Termination is explicit and irreversible.

---

## Architectural Role

This architecture provides the structural foundation for all boundary-dependent protocols and layers within the Epistheon system.

It does not prescribe execution mechanics or guidance.

---

## Canonical Statement

The Epistemic Boundary Architecture establishes a formal reference architecture for epistemic limits, responsibility, and termination.

It is complete, authoritative, and closed.

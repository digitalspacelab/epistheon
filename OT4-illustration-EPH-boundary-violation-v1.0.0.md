## Illustration Purpose

This executable illustration demonstrates a **boundary violation scenario** and the resulting **mandatory termination** under Epistheon.

It is non-authoritative and exists solely to illustrate enforcement behavior.

---

## Executable Flow

### Step 1 — Entry

- Intent is explicitly declared.
- Epistemic scope is stated narrowly.
- Responsibility is acknowledged.

---

### Step 2 — Boundary Declaration

- Scope limits are fixed.
- Explicit exclusion of out-of-scope topics is declared.
- Termination condition is named.

---

### Step 3 — Validation (EEP-A)

- Entry conditions are verified.
- Boundary validity is confirmed.
- Execution permission is granted.

---

### Step 4 — Epistemic Execution (EEP-B)

- Analysis begins within scope.
- An attempted expansion beyond declared scope occurs.
- Boundary awareness detects violation.

---

### Step 5 — Violation Handling

- Boundary violation is confirmed.
- Execution permission is revoked.
- Immediate termination is triggered.

---

### Step 6 — Termination & Closure (EEP-C)

- Execution context is closed.
- No results beyond boundary are produced.
- No continuation is implied.

---

## Illustration Constraint

This illustration:
- defines no rules
- modifies no architecture
- introduces no authority

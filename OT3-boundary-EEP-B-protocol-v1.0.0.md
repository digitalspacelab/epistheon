## Purpose

Epistemic Execution Protocol B (EEP-B) defines the conditions and constraints for conducting epistemic operations within an established boundary.

It governs analysis, reasoning, and elaboration while maintaining strict scope discipline.

---

## Protocol Scope

This protocol applies after successful completion of EEP-A.

It governs all epistemic operations performed within declared boundaries.

---

## Execution Discipline

During execution:
- scope may not be expanded
- authority may not be redefined
- responsibility remains explicit

Any violation invalidates execution.

---

## Elaboration Control

Elaboration, if present, must conform to the Epistemic Elaboration Layer.

No elaboration is permitted without prior EEL compliance.

---

## Monitoring Requirement

Execution must remain continuously boundary-aware.

Boundary drift requires immediate termination.

---

## Termination Condition

Execution under EEP-B terminates when:
- epistemic objective is satisfied
- scope is exhausted
- boundary violation occurs

Termination is explicit and final.

---

## Canonical Statement

Epistemic Execution Protocol B establishes disciplined epistemic operation within declared boundaries.

It is complete, enforceable, and closed.

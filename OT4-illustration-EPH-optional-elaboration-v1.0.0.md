## Illustration Purpose

This executable illustration demonstrates **optional elaboration** using the Epistemic Elaboration Layer (EEL) while maintaining strict boundary discipline.

It is non-authoritative and exists solely to illustrate compliant elaboration behavior.

---

## Executable Flow

### Step 1 — Entry

- Intent is explicitly declared.
- Scope is defined with room for optional elaboration.
- Responsibility is acknowledged.

---

### Step 2 — Boundary Declaration

- Scope limits are fixed.
- Elaboration is declared as optional, not required.
- Termination conditions are named.

---

### Step 3 — Validation (EEP-A)

- Entry conditions are verified.
- Boundary validity is confirmed.
- Execution permission is granted.

---

### Step 4 — Epistemic Execution (EEP-B)

- Primary analysis is completed within scope.
- Objective is partially satisfied.

---

### Step 5 — Optional Elaboration (EEL)

- Elaboration is explicitly invoked.
- Additional clarification and refinement occurs.
- No new scope or authority is introduced.

---

### Step 6 — Termination & Closure (EEP-C)

- Elaboration is concluded.
- Execution is explicitly terminated.
- Context is closed without carryover.

---

## Illustration Constraint

This illustration:
- defines no rules
- modifies no architecture
- introduces no authority

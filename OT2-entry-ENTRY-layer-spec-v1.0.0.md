## Purpose

The Entry Layer defines the mandatory entry conditions and orientation requirements for initiating epistemic operations within the Epistheon system.

It ensures that no analysis, generation, or execution occurs without prior orientation and boundary declaration.

---

## Entry Conditions

The following conditions must be satisfied prior to any epistemic operation:

1. Explicit declaration of intent
2. Definition of epistemic scope
3. Boundary establishment
4. Acceptance of responsibility

Failure to satisfy any condition invalidates further operation.

---

## Orientation Requirement

Orientation is mandatory and precedes all epistemic activity.

Orientation establishes the frame of reference, constraints, and termination expectations.

---

## Boundary Alignment

The Entry Layer enforces alignment with the Epistemic Boundary Architecture.

No operation may proceed beyond declared boundaries.

---

## Transition Rule

Successful completion of the Entry Layer permits transition to analysis or execution layers.

No implicit transition is allowed.

---

## Canonical Statement

The Entry Layer establishes mandatory entry and orientation conditions for epistemic operation.

It is complete, authoritative within scope, and closed.

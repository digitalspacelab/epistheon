## Purpose

The Epistemic Elaboration Layer (EEL) defines the conditions under which structured elaboration may occur following successful orientation and entry.

It enables controlled expansion, refinement, and articulation of epistemic content within declared boundaries.

---

## Elaboration Conditions

Elaboration may occur only after:

1. Successful completion of the Entry Layer
2. Valid boundary definition
3. Explicit acceptance of responsibility

Elaboration without these conditions is invalid.

---

## Elaboration Scope

Elaboration operates strictly within declared epistemic boundaries.

No elaboration may introduce new scope, authority, or objectives.

---

## Structural Discipline

Elaboration must remain:
- scope-bound
- responsibility-aware
- termination-ready

Elaboration may not override architectural or protocol constraints.

---

## Relation to Other Layers

The Epistemic Elaboration Layer is optional.

Its presence does not alter the minimal requirements defined by MEA.

---

## Termination Readiness

Elaboration must maintain explicit readiness for termination at all times.

No elaboration may defer or obscure termination conditions.

---

## Canonical Statement

The Epistemic Elaboration Layer defines controlled conditions for structured elaboration within epistemic operations.

It is complete, authoritative within scope, and closed.

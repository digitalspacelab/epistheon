## Purpose

Epistheon defines a formal architecture for epistemic orientation in human–LLM interaction.

It establishes invariant conditions for orientation, responsibility, boundary-setting, and termination prior to analysis, execution, or generation.

---

## Core Principle

Orientation precedes execution.

No analysis, generation, or decision is epistemically legitimate without an explicit orientation phase.

---

## Scope

This specification applies to all epistemic interactions conducted under the Epistheon system.

It defines the root conditions under which further architectures, layers, protocols, or guidance documents may operate.

---

## System Invariants

1. Orientation is mandatory.
2. Responsibility remains non-delegable.
3. Boundaries precede interpretation.
4. Termination is explicit.

---

## Structural Overview

Epistheon operates through a sequence of formally separated phases:

- Entry
- Orientation
- Boundary Definition
- Analysis or Execution
- Termination

No phase may be skipped or merged.

---

## Termination Rule

Epistheon defines conditions for epistemic operation only.

It does not authorize decisions, actions, or outcomes beyond orientation and structured analysis.

---

## Canonical Statement

Epistheon establishes a formal, invariant architecture for epistemic orientation.

It is complete, authoritative, and closed.
